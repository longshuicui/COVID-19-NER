{"text": "Comparative analysis of gene expression in virulent and attenuated strains of infectious bronchitis virus at sub-codon resolution\tInfectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a member of the genus Gammacoronavirus and the causative agent of avian infectious bronchitis. IBV has a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome ~27 kb in length and, like all coronaviruses, produces a set of sub-genomic messenger RNAs (sgmRNAs) synthesised via the viral polymerase. Here, we used RNA sequencing (RNASeq) and ribosome profiling (RiboSeq) to delineate gene expression in the IBV M41-CK and Beau-CK strains at sub-codon resolution. Quantification of reads flanking the programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) signal at the genomic RNA ORF1a/ORF1b junction revealed that PRF in IBV is highly efficient (33–40%), consistent with in vitro measurements. Triplet phasing of the profiling data allowed precise determination of reading frames and revealed the translation of two intergenic genes (4b and 4c on sgmRNA4), which are widely conserved across IBV isolates. RNASeq revealed two novel transcription junction sites in the attenuated Beau-CK strain, one of which would generate a sgmRNA encoding a ribosomally occupied ORF in the viral 3’ untranslated region (dORF). Within IBV transcripts, the nucleocapsid (N) protein was unexpectedly found to be inefficiently translated, despite being an abundant structural component of mature IBV virions. Finally, we demonstrate that the host cell response to IBV occurs primarily at the level of transcription, with a global up-regulation of immune-related mRNA transcripts following infection, and comparatively modest changes in the translation efficiencies of host genes. IMPORTANCE IBV is a major avian pathogen and presents a substantial economic burden to the poultry industry. Improved vaccination strategies are urgently needed to curb the global spread of this pathogen, and the development of suitable vaccine candidates will be aided by an improved understanding of IBV molecular biology. Our high-resolution data have enabled a precise study of transcription and translation in both pathogenic and attenuated forms of IBV, and expand our understanding of gammacoronaviral gene expression. We demonstrate that gene expression shows considerable intra-species variation, with single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with altered production of sgmRNA transcripts, and our RiboSeq data sets enabled us to uncover novel ribosomally occupied ORFs in both strains.

{"text": "The translational landscape of Zika virus during infection of mammalian and insect cells\tZika virus is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus of the family Flaviviridae, which has recently undergone a rapid expansion among humans in the Western Hemisphere. Here, we report a high-resolution map of ribosomal occupancy of the Zika virus genome during infection of mammalian and insect cells, obtained by ribosome profiling. In contrast to some other flaviviruses such as West Nile, we find no evidence for substantial frameshift-induced ribosomal drop-off during translation of the viral polyprotein, indicating that Zika virus must use alternative mechanisms to downregulate levels of catalytically active viral polymerase. We also show that high levels of ribosome-protected fragments map in-frame to two previously overlooked upstream open reading frames (uORFs) initiating at CUG and UUG codons, with likely consequences for the efficiency of polyprotein expression. Curiously, in African isolates of Zika virus, the two uORFs are fused in-frame into a single uORF. A parallel RNA-Seq analysis reveals the 5′ end position of the subgenomic flavivirus RNA in mammalian and insect cells. Together, these provide the first analysis of flavivirus gene expression by ribosome profiling. Author Summary Recent Zika virus outbreaks have been associated with congenital diseases and neurological complications. An enhanced understanding of the molecular biology of this pathogen may contribute towards the development of improved treatment and control methods. We present a single-codon resolution analysis of Zika virus translation in mammalian and mosquito cells using ribosome profiling. The analysis revealed two hitherto uncharacterized uORFs in the 5′ leader of Zika virus Brazilian isolate PE243, both of which are occupied by ribosomes during infection. In contrast, these two uORFs are fused into a single uORF in African isolates.

{"text": "Preliminary support for a 'dry swab, extraction free' protocol for SARS-CoV-2 testing via RT-qPCR\tThe urgent need for massively scaled clinical or surveillance testing for SARS-CoV-2 has necessitated a reconsideration of the methods by which respiratory samples are collected, transported, processed and tested. Conventional testing for SARS-CoV-2 involves collection of a clinical specimen with a nasopharyngeal swab, storage of the swab during transport in universal transport medium (UTM), extraction of RNA, and quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR). As testing has scaled across the world, supply chain challenges have emerged across this entire workflow. Here we sought to evaluate how eliminating the UTM storage and RNA extraction steps would impact the results of molecular testing. Using paired mid-turbinate swabs self-collected by 11 individuals with previously established SARS-CoV-2 positivity, we performed a comparison of conventional (swab → UTM → RNA extraction → RT-qPCR) vs. simplified (direct elution from dry swab → RT-qPCR) protocols.

{"text": "ACE2 Homo-dimerization, Human Genomic variants and Interaction of Host Proteins Explain High Population Specific Differences in Outcomes of COVID19\tSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a positive single stranded RNA virus that causes a highly contagious Corona Virus Disease (COVID19). Entry of SARS-CoV-2 in human cells depends on binding of the viral spike (S) proteins to cellular receptor Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and on S protein priming by host cell serine protease TMPRSS2. Recently COVID19 has been declared pandemic by World Health Organization yet high differences in disease outcomes across countries have been seen. We provide evidences based on analyses of existing public datasets and by using various in-silico approaches to explain some of these as factors that may explain population level differences. One of the key factors might be entry of virus in host cells due to differential interaction of viral proteins with host cell proteins due to different genetic backgrounds. Based on our findings, we conclude that higher expression of ACE2 facilitated by natural variations, acting as Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and with different frequencies in different populations, results in ACE2 homo-dimerization which is disadvantageous for TMPRSS2 mediated cleavage of ACE2 and becomes more difficult in presence of broad neutral amino acid transporter, B0AT1 (coded by SLC6A19), that usually does not express in Lungs. We also propose that the monomeric ACE2 has higher preferential binding with SARS-CoV-2 S-Protein vis-a-vis its dimerized counterpart. Further, eQTLs in TMPRSS2 and natural structural variations in the gene may also result in differential outcomes towards priming of viral S-protein, a critical step for entry of Virus in host cells. In addition, we suggest some other potential key host genes like ADAM17, RPS6, HNRNPA1, SUMO1, NACA, BTF3 and some other proteases as Cathepsins, that might have a critical role.

{"text": "Zika virus infection in Collaborative Cross mice\tThe 2015-2016 emergence of Zika virus (ZIKV) in the Americas, and recognition that ZIKV infection during pregnancy can result in birth defects, revealed a need for small animal models to study ZIKV pathogenic mechanisms and evaluate candidate vaccines and antivirals. Mice would be an attractive system for such studies, but ZIKV replicates poorly in laboratory mice because it fails to antagonize murine STAT2 and STING. To address this, most ZIKV pathogenesis studies have used mice with impaired interferon signaling (e.g. Ifnar1 −/− or treatment with IFNAR1-blocking antibodies). However, using mice with severe defects in innate antiviral signaling confounds studies of viral pathogenic mechanisms. Collaborative Cross (CC) mice have proven to be a valuable system for developing new mouse pathogenesis models for viral infections that are not well modeled in conventional laboratory mouse lines. To test whether CC mice could provide an immune-competent model for ZIKV pathogenesis, we infected CC lines with ZIKV and assessed weight loss, viremia, and production of neutralizing antibodies. We tested 21 CC lines (CC001, CC002, CC003, CC004, CC005, CC006, CC011, CC012, CC013, CC019, CC024, CC028, CC040, CC041, CC042, CC046, CC051, CC059, CC061, CC068, and CC072, 13 of which have non-functional alleles of the flavivirus restriction factor Oas1b) and 3 ZIKV strains (MR766, H/PF/2013, and a mouse-adapted variant of Dakar 41525).

Methods:  Respiratory samples including nasal swabs, throat swabs, sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were collected from Guangdong CDC confirmed NCP patients, and viral RNAs were detected using a CFDA approved detection kit. Results were analyzed in combination with sample collection date and clinical information.  Finding:  Except for BALF, the sputum possessed the highest positive rate (74.4%~88.9%), followed by nasal swabs (53.6%~73.3%) for both severe and mild cases during the first 14 days after illness onset (d.a.o). For samples collected ≥ 15 d.a.o, sputum and nasal swabs still possessed a high positive rate ranging from 42.9%~61.1%. The positive rate of throat swabs collected ≥ 8 d.a.o was low, especially in samples from mild cases.

Based on phylogeny, taxonomy and established practice, the CSG formally recognizes this virus as a sister to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoVs) of the species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus and designates it as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). To facilitate communication, the CSG further proposes to use the following naming convention for individual isolates: SARS-CoV-2/Isolate/Host/Date/Location. The spectrum of clinical manifestations associated with SARS-CoV-2 infections in humans remains to be determined. The independent zoonotic transmission of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 highlights the need for studying the entire (virus) species to complement research focused on individual pathogenic viruses of immediate significance.

{"text": "A Rapidly Deployable Negative Pressure Enclosure for Aerosol-Generating Medical Procedures\tAbstract Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic presents significant safety challenges to healthcare professionals. In some jurisdictions, over 10% of confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been found among healthcare workers. Aerosol-generating medical procedures (AGMPs) may increase the risk of nosocomial transmission, exacerbated by present global shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE). Improved methods for mitigating risk during AGMPs are therefore urgently needed. Methods The Aerosol Containment Enclosure (ACE) was constructed from acrylic with silicone gaskets for arm port seals and completed with a thin plastic sheet. Hospital wall suction generated negative pressure within the ACE. To evaluate protective capability, differential pressures were recorded under static conditions and during simulated AGMPs. Smoke flow patterns, fluorescence aerosolization, and sodium saccharin aerosolization tests were also conducted.   Results Negative pressures of up to −47.7 mmH O were obtained using the enclosure with two wall suction units (combined outflow of 70 L min ), with inflow of O of 15 L min . Negative pressures between −10 and −35 mmH O were maintained during simulated AGMPs, including oxygen delivery by mask, airway suctioning, bag-mask manual ventilation and endotracheal intubation of a potential COVID-19 patient. The ACE effectively contained smoke, fluorescein aerosol, and sodium saccharin aerosol within the enclosure during use.  Conclusions The ACE is capable of maintaining negative pressure during simulated AGMPs. In all cases, containment was improved relative to an identical enclosure with non-occluded ports at ambient pressure.  During the current COVID-19 pandemic, the use of such a device may assist in reducing nosocomial infections among healthcare providers.", "entities": [{"entity": "COVID-19", "type": "Disease", "start": 141, "end": 149}, {"entity": "COVID-19", "type": "Disease", "start": 282, "end": 290}, {"entity": "COVID-19", "type": "Disease", "start": 1438, "end": 1446}, {"entity": "COVID-19", "type": "Disease", "start": 1804, "end": 1812}, {"entity": "AGMPs", "type": "Gene", "start": 372, "end": 377}, {"entity": "AGMPs", "type": "Gene", "start": 553, "end": 558}, {"entity": "AGMPs", "type": "Gene", "start": 932, "end": 937}, {"entity": "AGMPs", "type": "Gene", "start": 1306, "end": 1311}, {"entity": "AGMPs", "type": "Gene", "start": 1658, "end": 1663}, {"entity": "nosocomial", "type": "Disease", "start": 404, "end": 414}, {"entity": "PPE", "type": "Gene", "start": 503, "end": 506}, {"entity": "acrylic", "type": "Drug", "start": 659, "end": 666}, {"entity": "sodium saccharin", "type": "Drug", "start": 993, "end": 1009}, {"entity": "sodium saccharin", "type": "Drug", "start": 1518, "end": 1534}, {"entity": "−35 mmH O", "type": "Gene", "start": 1263, "end": 1272}, {"entity": "fluorescein", "type": "Drug", "start": 1493, "end": 1504}]}

Reusable elastomeric respirators are suitable alternatives when used with compatible filters. These filters may be difficult to source and elastomeric respirators are not recommended for surgical use as the exhaled air is not filtered. Breathing system filters are routinely used in anaesthetic circuits to filter virus and bacteria. In this study, we designed 3D printed adapters that allowed elastomeric respirators to utilise breathing system filters and made simple modifications to the respirators to filter exhaled breaths. We then evaluated the performance and safety of our modified elastomeric respirators with quantitative fit tests.  We recruited 8 volunteers to perform quantitative fit tests. Fit factors, respiratory rate and end-tidal carbon dioxide were recorded before and after wearing the modified respirators for 1 hour. All 8 volunteers obtained fit factors of 200+, the maximum achievable, for all tests exercises in all fit tests.

{"text": "DUSP1 regulates apoptosis and cell migration, but not the JIP1-protected cytokine response, during Respiratory Syncytial Virus and Sendai Virus infection\tThe host antiviral response involves the induction of interferons and proinflammatory cytokines, but also the activation of cell death pathways, including apoptosis, to limit viral replication and spreading. This host defense is strictly regulated to eliminate the infection while limiting tissue damage that is associated with virus pathogenesis. Post-translational modifications, most notably phosphorylation, are key regulators of the antiviral defense implying an important role of protein phosphatases. Here, we investigated the role of the dual-specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1) in the host defense against human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a pathogenic virus of the Pneumoviridae family, and Sendai virus (SeV), a model virus being developed as a vector for anti-RSV vaccine. We found that DUSP1 is upregulated before being subjected to proteasomal degradation. DUSP1 does not inhibit the antiviral response, but negatively regulates virus-induced JNK/p38 MAPK phosphorylation.

The function(s) of PARP2 is far from complete, and the mechanism(s) by which the gene and protein are regulated are unknown. In this study, we found that two different mechanisms are used in vitro to regulate PARP2 levels. In the presence of serum, PARP2 is degraded through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, however, when serum is removed, PARP2 is rapidly sequestered into an SDS- and urea-insoluble fraction. This sequestration is relieved by serum in a dose-dependent manner, and again PARP2 is detected by immunoblotting. Furthermore, and despite the presence of a putative serum response element in the PARP2 gene, transcription is not affected by serum deprivation.

Design: Cross sectional study  Setting: Sweden  Participants: 9,624,428 individuals living in Sweden on 31st December 2014 and alive on 1st January 2016  Main outcome measures: Burden and prevalence of prognostic factors for severe COVID-19 based on the guidelines from the World Health Organization and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, which are age 70 years and older, cardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, severe asthma, and diabetes. Prognostic factors were identified based on records for three years before 1st January 2016 from the Swedish National Inpatient and Outpatient Specialist Care Register, Prescribed Drug Register, and Cancer Register.   Results: 22.1% of the study population had at least one prognostic factor for severe COVID-19 (2,131,319 individuals), and 1.6% had at least three factors (154,746 individuals). The prevalence of underlying medical conditions in the whole study population ranged from 0.8% with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (78,516 individuals) to 7.4% with cardiovascular disease (708,090 individuals), and the county specific prevalence of at least one prognostic factor ranged from 19.2% in Stockholm (416,988 individuals) to 25.9% in Kalmar (60,005 individuals).   Conclusions: The prevalence of prognostic factors for severe COVID-19 disease will aid authorities in optimally planning healthcare resources during the ongoing pandemic.

{"text": "Epidemiological impact of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination: mathematical modeling analyses\tBackground: Several SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates are currently in the pipeline. This study aims to inform SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development, licensure, decision-making, and implementation by determining key preferred vaccine product characteristics and associated population-level impact. Methods: Vaccination impact was assessed at various efficacies using an age-structured mathematical model describing SARS-CoV-2 transmission and disease progression, with application for China.  Results: A prophylactic vaccine with efficacy against acquisition (VEs) of ≥70% is needed to eliminate this infection. A vaccine with VEs <70% will still have a major impact, and may control the infection if it reduces infectiousness or infection duration among those vaccinated who acquire the infection, or alternatively if supplemented with a moderate social-distancing intervention (<20% reduction in contact rate), or complemented with herd immunity. Vaccination is cost-effective. For a vaccine with VEs of 50%, number of vaccinations needed to avert one infection is only 2.4, one severe disease case is 25.5, one critical disease case is 33.2, and one death is 65.1. Gains in effectiveness are achieved by initially prioritizing those ≥60 years. Probability of a major outbreak is virtually zero with a vaccine with VEs ≥70%, regardless of number of virus introductions. Yet, an increase in social contact rate among those vaccinated (behavior compensation) can undermine vaccine impact.  Conclusions: Even a partially-efficacious vaccine can offer a fundamental solution to control SARS-CoV-2 infection and at high cost-effectiveness. In addition to the primary endpoint on infection acquisition, developers should assess natural history and disease progression outcomes and/or proxy biomarkers, since such secondary endpoints may prove critical in licensure, decision-making, and vaccine impact.", "entities": [{"entity": "candidates", "type": "Gene", "start": 120, "end": 130}, {"entity": "vaccine", "type": "Drug", "start": 112, "end": 119}, {"entity": "vaccine", "type": "Drug", "start": 199, "end": 206}, {"entity": "vaccine", "type": "Drug", "start": 296, "end": 303}, {"entity": "vaccine", "type": "Drug", "start": 587, "end": 594}, {"entity": "vaccine", "type": "Drug", "start": 684, "end": 691}, {"entity": "vaccine", "type": "Drug", "start": 1056, "end": 1063}, {"entity": "vaccine", "type": "Drug", "start": 1374, "end": 1381}, {"entity": "vaccine", "type": "Drug", "start": 1543, "end": 1550}, {"entity": "vaccine", "type": "Drug", "start": 1602, "end": 1609}, {"entity": "vaccine", "type": "Drug", "start": 1953, "end": 1960}, {"entity": "VEs", "type": "Disease", "start": 630, "end": 633}, {"entity": "VEs", "type": "Disease", "start": 697, "end": 700}, {"entity": "VEs", "type": "Disease", "start": 1069, "end": 1072}, {"entity": "VEs", "type": "Disease", "start": 1387, "end": 1390}, {"entity": "disease case", "type": "Disease", "start": 1158, "end": 1170}, {"entity": "disease case", "type": "Disease", "start": 1193, "end": 1205}, {"entity": "primary endpoint", "type": "Chemical", "start": 1726, "end": 1742}]}

{"text": "Tracing DAY-ZERO and Forecasting the Fade out of the COVID-19 Outbreak in Lombardy, Italy: A Compartmental Modelling and Numerical Optimization Approach.\tItaly currently constitutes the epicenter of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, having surpassed China's death toll. The disease is sweeping through Lombardy, which remains in lockdown since the 8th of March. As of the same day, the isolation measures taken in Lombardy have been extended to the entire country. Here,  we provide estimates for: (a) the DAY-ZERO of the outbreak in Lombardy, Italy; (b) the actual number of exposed/infected cases in the total population; (c) the basic reproduction number (R0); (d) the \"effective\" per-day disease transmission; and, importantly, (e) a forecast for the fade out of the outbreak, on the basis of the COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports released by Google on March 29.  Methods. To deal with the uncertainty in the number of actual exposed/ infected cases in the total population, we address a compartmental Susceptible/ Exposed/ Infectious/ Recovered/ Dead (SEIRD) model with two compartments of infectious persons: one modelling the total cases in the population and another modelling the confirmed cases. The parameters of the model corresponding to the recovery period, the time from the onset of symptoms to death, the case fatality ratio, and the time from exposure to the time that an individual starts to be infectious, have been set as reported from clinical studies on COVID-19. For the estimation of the DAY-ZERO of the outbreak in Lombardy, as well as of the ``effective\" per-day transmission rate for which no clinical data are available, we have used the SEIRD simulator to fit the numbers of new daily cases from February 21 to the 8th of March, the lockdown day of Lombardy and of all Italy. This was accomplished by solving a mixed-integer optimization problem with the aid of genetic algorithms. Based on the computed values, we also provide an estimation of the basic reproduction number $R_0$. Furthermore, based on an estimation for the reduction in the \"effective\" transmission rate of the disease as of March 8 that reflects the suspension of almost all activities in Italy, we ran the simulator to forecast the fade out of the epidemic. For this purpose, we considered the reduction in mobility in Lombardy  as released on March 29 by Google COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports, the effect of social distancing, and the draconian measures taken by the government on March 20 and March 21, 2020. Results. Based on the proposed methodological procedure, we estimated that the DAY-ZERO was most likely between January 5 and January 23 with the most probable date the 15th of January 2020. The actual cumulative number of exposed cases in the total population in Lombardy on March 8 was of the order of 15 times the confirmed cumulative number of infected cases. The \"effective\" per-day disease transmission rate for the period until March 8 was found to be 0.686 (95% CI:0.660, 0.713), while the basic reproduction number R0 was found to be 4.51 (95% CI: 4.14, 4.90).

{"text": "Systematic review and meta-analysis of predictive symptoms and comorbidities for severe COVID-19 infection\tCOVID−19, a novel coronavirus outbreak starting in China, is now a rapidly developing public health emergency of international concern. The clinical spectrum of COVID−19 disease is varied, and identifying factors associated with severe disease has been described as an urgent research priority. It has been noted that elderly patients with pre-existing comorbidities are more vulnerable to more severe disease. However, the specific symptoms and comorbidities that most strongly predict disease severity are unclear. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify the symptoms and comorbidities predictive of COVID−19 severity. This study was prospectively registered on PROSPERO. A literature search was performed in three databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE and Global Health) for studies indexed up to 5 March 2020. Two reviewers independently screened the literature and both also completed data extraction. Quality appraisal of studies was performed using the STROBE checklist. Random effects meta-analysis was performed for selected symptoms and comorbidities to identify those most associated with severe COVID−19 infection or ICU admission. Of the 2259 studies identified, 42 were selected after title and abstract analysis, and 7 studies (including 1813 COVID−19 patients) were chosen for inclusion. The ICU group were older (62.4 years) compared to the non-ICU group (46 years), with a significantly higher proportion of males (67.2% vs. 57.1%, p=0.04). Dyspnoea was the only significant symptom predictive for both severe disease (pOR 3.70, 95% CI 1.83 − 7.46) and ICU admission (pOR 6.55, 95% CI 4.28 − 10.0). Notwithstanding the low prevalence of COPD in severe disease and ICU-admitted groups (4.5% and 9.7%, respectively), COPD was the most strongly predictive comorbidity for both severe disease (pOR 6.42, 95% CI 2.44 − 16.9) and ICU admission (pOR 17.8, 95% CI 6.56 − 48.2). Cardiovascular disease and hypertension were also strongly predictive for both severe disease and ICU admission. Those with CVD and hypertension were 4.4 (95% CI 2.64 − 7.47) and 3.7 (95% CI 2.22 − 5.99) times more likely to have an ICU admission respectively, compared to patients without the comorbidity. Dyspnoea was the only symptom strongly predictive for both severe disease and ICU admission, and could be useful in guiding clinical management decisions early in the course of illness. When looking at ICU-admitted patients, who represent the more severe end of the spectrum of clinical severity, COPD patients are particularly vulnerable, and those with cardiovascular disease and hypertension are also at a high-risk of severe illness. To aid clinical assessment, risk stratification, efficient resource allocation, and targeted public health interventions, future research must aim to further define those at high-risk of severe illness with COVID−19.", "entities": [{"entity": "predictive symptoms", "type": "Phenotype", "start": 39, "end": 58}, {"entity": "EMBASE", "type": "Chemical", "start": 867, "end": 873}, {"entity": "Dyspnoea", "type": "Phenotype", "start": 1578, "end": 1586}, {"entity": "Dyspnoea", "type": "Phenotype", "start": 2314, "end": 2322}, {"entity": "symptom", "type": "Phenotype", "start": 1612, "end": 1619}, {"entity": "symptom", "type": "Phenotype", "start": 2336, "end": 2343}, {"entity": "severe disease", "type": "Disease", "start": 336, "end": 350}, {"entity": "severe disease", "type": "Disease", "start": 502, "end": 516}, {"entity": "severe disease", "type": "Disease", "start": 1640, "end": 1654}, {"entity": "severe disease", "type": "Disease", "start": 1782, "end": 1796}, {"entity": "severe disease", "type": "Disease", "start": 1911, "end": 1925}, {"entity": "severe disease", "type": "Disease", "start": 2086, "end": 2100}, {"entity": "severe disease", "type": "Disease", "start": 2373, "end": 2387}, {"entity": "pOR", "type": "Gene", "start": 1656, "end": 1659}, {"entity": "pOR", "type": "Gene", "start": 1705, "end": 1708}, {"entity": "pOR", "type": "Gene", "start": 1927, "end": 1930}, {"entity": "pOR", "type": "Gene", "start": 1976, "end": 1979}, {"entity": "Cardiovascular disease", "type": "Disease", "start": 2007, "end": 2029}, {"entity": "hypertension", "type": "Disease", "start": 2034, "end": 2046}, {"entity": "hypertension", "type": "Disease", "start": 2139, "end": 2151}, {"entity": "hypertension", "type": "Disease", "start": 2696, "end": 2708}, {"entity": "CVD", "type": "Disease", "start": 2131, "end": 2134}, {"entity": "cardiovascular disease", "type": "Disease", "start": 2669, "end": 2691}]}

{"text": "Diagnosis and Prediction Model for COVID19 Patients Response to Treatment based on Convolutional Neural Networks and Whale Optimization Algorithm Using CT Images\tThe outbreak of coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) has rabidly spread all over the world. The World Health Organization (WHO) has announced that coronavirus COVID19 is an international pandemic. The Real-Time Reverse transcription polymerase Chain Reaction (RTPCR) has a low positive and sensitivity rate in the early stage of COVID19. As a result, the Computed Tomography (CT) imaging is used for diagnosing. COVID19 has different key signs on a CT scan differ from other viral pneumonia. These signs include ground glass opacities, consolidations, and crazy paving. In this paper, an Artificial Intelligence-inspired Model for COVID19 Diagnosis and Prediction for Patient Response to Treatment (AIMDP) is proposed. AIMDP model has two main functions reflected in two proposed modules, namely, the Diagnosis Module (DM) and Prediction Module (PM). The Diagnosis Module (DM) is proposed for early and accurately detecting the patients with COVID 19 and distinguish it from other viral pneumonias using COVID19 signs obtained from CT scans. The DM model, uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) as a Deep learning technique for segmentation, can process hundreds of CT images in seconds to speed up diagnosis of COVID19 and contribute in its containment. In addition, some countries have no ability to provide all patients with the treatment and intensive care services, so it will be mandatory to give treatment to only responding patients.  In this context, the Prediction Module (PM) is proposed for predicting the ability of the patient to respond to treatment based on different factors e.g. age, infection stage, respiratory failure, multi-organ failure and the treatment regimens. PM implement the Whale Optimization Algorithm for selecting the most relevant patients features. The experimental results show promising performance for the proposed diagnosing and prediction modules, using a dataset with hundreds of real data and CT images.", "entities": [{"entity": "COVID19", "type": "Chemical", "start": 35, "end": 42}, {"entity": "COVID19", "type": "Chemical", "start": 316, "end": 323}, {"entity": "COVID19", "type": "Chemical", "start": 486, "end": 493}, {"entity": "COVID19", "type": "Chemical", "start": 569, "end": 576}, {"entity": "COVID19", "type": "Chemical", "start": 788, "end": 795}, {"entity": "COVID19", "type": "Chemical", "start": 1161, "end": 1168}, {"entity": "COVID19", "type": "Chemical", "start": 1372, "end": 1379}, {"entity": "coronavirus diseases", "type": "Virus", "start": 178, "end": 198}, {"entity": "COVID-19", "type": "Disease", "start": 200, "end": 208}, {"entity": "viral pneumonia", "type": "Disease", "start": 632, "end": 647}, {"entity": "consolidations", "type": "Disease", "start": 693, "end": 707}, {"entity": "PM", "type": "Gene", "start": 1003, "end": 1005}, {"entity": "PM", "type": "Gene", "start": 1643, "end": 1645}, {"entity": "PM", "type": "Gene", "start": 1848, "end": 1850}, {"entity": "COVID", "type": "Virus", "start": 1099, "end": 1104}, {"entity": "viral pneumonias", "type": "Disease", "start": 1138, "end": 1154}, {"entity": "CNNs", "type": "Disease", "start": 1249, "end": 1253}, {"entity": "respiratory failure", "type": "Disease", "start": 1779, "end": 1798}]}

{"text": "The Infectious Bronchitis Virus Coronavirus Envelope Protein Alters Golgi pH to Protect Spike Protein and Promote Release of Infectious Virus\tCoronaviruses (CoVs) are important human pathogens with significant zoonotic potential. Progress has been made toward identifying potential vaccine candidates for highly pathogenic human CoVs, including use of attenuated viruses that lack the CoV envelope (E) protein or express E mutants. However, no approved vaccines or anti-viral therapeutics exist. CoVs assemble by budding into the lumen of the early Golgi prior to exocytosis. The small CoV E protein plays roles in assembly, virion release, and pathogenesis. CoV E has a single hydrophobic domain (HD), is targeted to Golgi membranes, and has cation channel activity in vitro . The E protein from the avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) has dramatic effects on the secretory system, which requires residues in the HD. Mutation of the HD of IBV E during infection results in impaired growth kinetics, impaired release of infectious virions, accumulation of IBV S protein on the plasma membrane when compared IBV WT infected cells, and aberrant cleavage of IBV S on the surface of virions. We previously reported the formation of two distinct oligomeric pools of IBV E in transfected and infected cells. Disruption of the secretory pathway by IBV E correlates with a form that is likely monomeric, suggesting that the effects on the secretory pathway are independent of E ion channel activity. Here, we present evidence suggesting that the monomeric form of IBV E correlates with a rise in the pH of the Golgi lumen. We demonstrate that infection with IBV induces neutralization of Golgi luminal pH, promoting a model in which IBV E alters the secretory pathway through interaction with host cells factors, protecting IBV spike protein (S) from premature cleavage and leading to the efficient release of infectious virus from the cells.", "entities": [{"entity": "Infectious Bronchitis Virus", "type": "Virus", "start": 4, "end": 31}, {"entity": "Coronavirus Envelope Protein", "type": "Gene", "start": 32, "end": 60}, {"entity": "Protect Spike Protein", "type": "Gene", "start": 80, "end": 101}, {"entity": "Infectious Virus", "type": "Disease", "start": 125, "end": 141}, {"entity": "CoVs", "type": "Virus", "start": 157, "end": 161}, {"entity": "CoVs", "type": "Virus", "start": 329, "end": 333}, {"entity": "CoVs", "type": "Virus", "start": 496, "end": 500}, {"entity": "zoonotic", "type": "Disease", "start": 210, "end": 218}, {"entity": "vaccine", "type": "Drug", "start": 282, "end": 289}, {"entity": "candidates", "type": "Gene", "start": 290, "end": 300}, {"entity": "vaccines", "type": "Drug", "start": 453, "end": 461}, {"entity": "HD", "type": "Disease", "start": 698, "end": 700}, {"entity": "HD", "type": "Disease", "start": 918, "end": 920}, {"entity": "HD", "type": "Disease", "start": 938, "end": 940}, {"entity": "E protein", "type": "Gene", "start": 590, "end": 599}, {"entity": "E protein", "type": "Gene", "start": 782, "end": 791}, {"entity": "infectious bronchitis virus", "type": "Virus", "start": 807, "end": 834}, {"entity": "IBV", "type": "Gene", "start": 836, "end": 839}, {"entity": "IBV", "type": "Gene", "start": 1060, "end": 1063}, {"entity": "IBV", "type": "Gene", "start": 1111, "end": 1114}, {"entity": "IBV", "type": "Gene", "start": 1159, "end": 1162}, {"entity": "IBV", "type": "Gene", "start": 1654, "end": 1657}, {"entity": "IBV", "type": "Gene", "start": 1820, "end": 1823}, {"entity": "IBV E", "type": "Gene", "start": 944, "end": 949}, {"entity": "IBV E", "type": "Gene", "start": 1265, "end": 1270}, {"entity": "IBV E", "type": "Gene", "start": 1345, "end": 1350}, {"entity": "IBV E", "type": "Gene", "start": 1560, "end": 1565}, {"entity": "IBV E", "type": "Gene", "start": 1729, "end": 1734}, {"entity": "alters", "type": "Disease", "start": 1735, "end": 1741}, {"entity": "infectious virus", "type": "Disease", "start": 1906, "end": 1922}]}

{"text": "Targeting SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein of COVID-19 with Naturally Occurring Phytochemicals: An in Silco Study for Drug Development\tSpike glycoprotein found on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2S) is a class I fusion protein which helps the virus in its initial attachment with human Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and its consecutive fusion with the host cells. The attachment is mediated by the S1 subunit of the protein via its receptor binding domain. Upon binding with the receptor the protein changes its conformation from a pre-fusion to a post-fusion form. The membrane fusion and internalization of the virus is brought about by the S2 domain of the spike protein. From ancient times people have relied on naturally occurring substances like phytochemicals to fight against diseases and infection.  Among these phytochemicals, flavonoids and non-flavonoids have been found to be the active source of different anti-microbial agents.  Recently, studies have shown that these phytochemicals have essential anti-viral activities. We performed a molecular docking study using 10 potential naturally occurring flavonoids/non-flavonoids against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and compared their affinity with the FDA approved drug hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). Interestingly, the docking analysis suggested that C-terminal of S1 domain and S2 domain of the spike protein are important for binding with these compounds. Kamferol, curcumin, pterostilbene, and HCQ interact with the C-terminal of S1 domain with binding energies of -7.4, -7.1, -6.7 and -5.6 Kcal/mol, respectively.

{"text": "Temporal relationship between outbound traffic from Wuhan and the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) incidence in China\tBackground: The city of Wuhan is the epicenter of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak and a central Chinese hub for transportation and industry. Mass migration prior to the Chinese New Year may have accelerated the spread of COVID-19 across China. This analysis investigated the temporal relationship between daily outbound traffic from Wuhan and the incidence of COVID-19 in 31 Chinese provinces during January-February 2020.   Methods: We collected incidence of confirmed COVID-19 cases from National and Provincial Health Committee reports from January 10 to February 29, 2020. Volume of outbound traffic from Wuhan to other provinces was measured by Baidu Migration Index, a widely used metric that tracks migration based on cellphone location. We used cross-correlation function and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model to examine time-lagged association between traffic volume and COVID-19 incidence by province. Contributors to the provincial variation in the temporal associations were investigated. Additionally, we estimated the reduction in cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases following the travel ban for Wuhan.   Results: Cross-correlation function analyses suggested that the volume of outbound traffic from Wuhan was positively associated with COVID-19 incidence in all provinces, with correlation coefficients between 0.22-0.78 (all P<0.05). Approximately 42% of provinces showed <1 week of lag between traffic volume and COVID-19 incidence, 39% with 1 week, and 19% with 2-3 weeks. Migration had more prolonged impacts in provinces closer to Wuhan and with more passenger influx from Wuhan, but affected economically advantaged provinces to a lesser extent. We further estimated that the travel ban may have prevented approximately 19,768 COVID-19 cases (95% CI: 13,589, 25,946) outside of Wuhan by February 29, 2020.   Conclusions: Outflowing migration from Wuhan facilitated the COVID-19 transmission to other parts of China with varying time-lagged effects dependent on provincial characteristics.

We aim to predict COVID-19 cases and compare effectiveness of mitigation measures across coun- tries to inform policy decision making. Methods: We propose a survival-convolution model for predicting key statistics of COVID-19 epidemics (daily new cases). We account for transmission during a pre- symptomatic incubation period and use a time-varying reproduction number (Rt) to reflect the temporal trend of transmission and change in response to an intervention. We estimate the intervention effect on reducing the infection rate and quantify uncer- tainty by permutation. Findings: Our model adequately estimated observed daily new cases and could predict the entire disease epidemic using data from the early phase. A fast rate of decline in Rt was observed in China and South Korea. In Italy, Rt decreased at a slower rate and did not change significantly before the nation-wide lockdown and two-weeks after. In the United States (US), there was a significant change in Rt before and after the declaration of national emergency. Interpretation: Adopting mitigation strategies early in the epidemic is effective in reducing the infection rate. The lockdown in Italy did not further accelerate the speed at which the infection rate decreases and the epidemic is not yet under control.

However, the viral dynamics, host serologic responses, and their associations with clinical manifestations, have not been well described in prospective cohort. We conducted a prospective cohort and enrolled 67 COVID-19 patients admitting between Jan 26 and Feb 5, 2020. Clinical specimens including nasopharyngeal swab, sputum, blood, urine and stool were tested periodically according to standardized case report form with final follow-up on February 27. The routes and duration of viral shedding, antibody response, and their associations with disease severity and clinical manifestations were systematically evaluated. Coronaviral particles in clinical specimens were observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The median duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding were 12 (3-38), 19 (5-37), and 18 (7-26) days in nasopharyngeal swabs, sputum and stools, respectively. Only 13 urines (5.6%) and 12 plasmas (5.7%) were viral positive. Prolonged viral shedding was observed in severe patients than that of non-severe patients. Cough but not fever, aligned with viral shedding in clinical respiratory specimens, meanwhile the positive stool-RNA appeared to align with the proportion who concurrently had cough and sputum production, but not diarrhea. Typical coronaviral particles could be found directly in sputum by TEM. The anti-nucleocapsid-protein IgM started on day 7 and positive rate peaked on day 28, while that of IgG was on day 10 and day 49 after illness onset. IgM and IgG appear earlier, and their titers are significantly higher in severe patients than non-severe patients (p<0.05). The weak responders for IgG had a significantly higher viral clearance rate than that of strong responders (p= 0.011). Nasopharyngeal, sputum and stools rather than blood and urine, were the major shedding routes for SARS-CoV-2, and meanwhile sputum had a prolonged viral shedding.

{"text": "Bat coronavirus phylogeography in the Western Indian Ocean\tBats provide key ecosystem services such as crop pest regulation, pollination, seed dispersal, and soil fertilization. Bats are also major hosts for biological agents responsible for zoonoses, such as coronaviruses (CoVs). The islands of the Western Indian Ocean are identified as a major biodiversity hotspot, with more than 50 bat species. In this study, we tested 1,013 bats belonging to 36 species from Mozambique, Madagascar, Mauritius, Mayotte, Reunion Island and Seychelles, based on molecular screening and partial sequencing of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene. In total, 88 bats (8.7%) tested positive for coronaviruses, with higher prevalence in Mozambican bats (20.5% ± 4.9%) as compared to those sampled on islands (4.5% ± 1.5%). Phylogenetic analyses revealed a large diversity of α- and β-CoVs and a strong signal of co-evolution between CoVs and their bat host species, with limited evidence for host-switching, except for bat species sharing day roost sites. Importance This is the first study to report the presence of coronaviruses (CoVs) in bats in Mayotte, Mozambique and Reunion Island, and in insectivorous bats in Madagascar. Eight percent of the tested bats were positive for CoVs, with higher prevalence in continental Africa than on islands. A high genetic diversity of α- and β-CoVs was found, with strong association between bat host and virus phylogenies, supporting a long history of co-evolution between bats and their associated CoVs in the Western Indian Ocean.

{"text": "Cryo-EM structures of HKU2 and SADS-CoV spike glycoproteins and insights into coronavirus evolution\tA new porcine coronavirus SADS-CoV was recently identified from suckling piglets with severe diarrhea in southern China and its genome sequence is most identical (~95% identity) to that of bat α-coronavirus HKU2. It again indicates bats are the natural reservoir of many coronaviruses that have great potential for cross-species transmission to animals and humans by recombination and/or mutation. Here we report the cryo-EM structures of HKU2 and SADS-CoV spike glycoprotein trimers at 2.38 Å and 2.83 Å resolution, respectively. HKU2 and SADS-CoV spikes exhibit very high structural similarity, with subtle differences mainly distributed in the NTD and CTD of the S1 subunit responsible for cell attachment and receptor binding. We systematically analyzed and compared the NTD, CTD, SD1 and SD2 domains of the S1 subunit and the S2 subunit of HKU2 spike with those of α-, β-, γ-, and δ-coronavirus spikes.

{"text": "A Multiscale and Comparative Model for Receptor Binding of 2019 Novel Coronavirus and the Implication of its Life Cycle in Host Cells\tThe respiratory syndrome caused by a new type of coronavirus has been emerging from China and caused more than 1000 death globally since December 2019. This new virus, called 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) uses the same receptor called Angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to attack humans as the coronavirus that caused the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) seventeen years ago. Both viruses recognize ACE2 through the spike proteins (S-protein) on their surfaces. It was found that the S-protein from the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) bind stronger to ACE2 than 2019-nCoV. However, function of a bio-system is often under kinetic, rather than thermodynamic, control. To address this issue, we constructed a structural model for complex formed between ACE2 and the S-protein from 2019-nCoV, so that the rate of their association can be estimated and compared with the binding of S-protein from SARS-CoV by a multiscale simulation method. Our simulation results suggest that the association of new virus to the receptor is slower than SARS, which is consistent with the experimental data obtained very recently. We further integrated this difference of association rate between virus and receptor into a mathematical model which describes the life cycle of virus in host cells and its interplay with the innate immune system. Interestingly, we found that the slower association between virus and receptor can result in longer incubation period, while still maintaining a relatively higher level of viral concentration in human body. Our computational study therefore provides, from the molecular level, one possible explanation that the new disease by far spread much faster than SARS.", "entities": [{"entity": "Coronavirus", "type": "Virus", "start": 70, "end": 81}, {"entity": "respiratory syndrome", "type": "Disease", "start": 138, "end": 158}, {"entity": "coronavirus", "type": "Virus", "start": 183, "end": 194}, {"entity": "coronavirus", "type": "Virus", "start": 320, "end": 331}, {"entity": "coronavirus", "type": "Virus", "start": 436, "end": 447}, {"entity": "2019-nCoV", "type": "Virus", "start": 333, "end": 342}, {"entity": "2019-nCoV", "type": "Virus", "start": 708, "end": 717}, {"entity": "2019-nCoV", "type": "Virus", "start": 925, "end": 934}, {"entity": "receptor", "type": "Gene", "start": 358, "end": 366}, {"entity": "receptor", "type": "Gene", "start": 1155, "end": 1163}, {"entity": "receptor", "type": "Gene", "start": 1332, "end": 1340}, {"entity": "receptor", "type": "Gene", "start": 1540, "end": 1548}, {"entity": "Angiotensinconverting enzyme 2", "type": "Gene", "start": 374, "end": 404}, {"entity": "ACE2", "type": "Gene", "start": 406, "end": 410}, {"entity": "ACE2", "type": "Gene", "start": 549, "end": 553}, {"entity": "ACE2", "type": "Gene", "start": 698, "end": 702}, {"entity": "ACE2", "type": "Gene", "start": 897, "end": 901}, {"entity": "acute respiratory syndrome", "type": "Disease", "start": 471, "end": 497}, {"entity": "SARS", "type": "Disease", "start": 499, "end": 503}, {"entity": "SARS", "type": "Disease", "start": 1179, "end": 1183}, {"entity": "SARS", "type": "Disease", "start": 1824, "end": 1828}, {"entity": "spike proteins", "type": "Gene", "start": 566, "end": 580}, {"entity": "S-protein", "type": "Gene", "start": 582, "end": 591}, {"entity": "S-protein", "type": "Gene", "start": 634, "end": 643}, {"entity": "S-protein", "type": "Gene", "start": 910, "end": 919}, {"entity": "S-protein", "type": "Gene", "start": 1024, "end": 1033}, {"entity": "SARS coronavirus", "type": "Virus", "start": 653, "end": 669}, {"entity": "SARS-CoV", "type": "Virus", "start": 671, "end": 679}, {"entity": "SARS-CoV", "type": "Virus", "start": 1039, "end": 1047}]}

Interventions were either implemented for fixed durations or dynamically cycled on and off, based on projected ICU bed occupancy. We present median and credible intervals (CrI) from 100 replicates per scenario using a two-year time horizon.  Results: We estimated that 56% (95% CrI: 42-63%) of the Ontario population would be infected over the course of the epidemic in the base case.

Dynamic social distancing interventions could reduce the median number of cases in ICU below current estimates of Ontario's ICU capacity.

{"text": "AN EPIDEMIOLOGICAL MODEL TO AID DECISION-MAKING FOR COVID-19 CONTROL IN SRI LANKA\tBackground: Sri Lanka diagnosed its first local case of COVID-19 on 11 March 2020.  The government acted swiftly to contain transmission, with extensive public health measures. At the end of 30 days, Sri Lanka had 197 cases, 54 recovered and 7 deaths; a staged relaxing of the lockdown is now underway. This paper proposes a theoretical basis for estimating the limits within which transmission should be constrained in order to ensure that the case load remains within the capacity of the health system.  Methods: We used the Susceptible, Infected, Recovered (SIR) model to explore the number of new infections and estimate ICU bed requirement at different levels of R0 values after lockout. We developed a web-based application that enables visualization of cases and ICU bed requirements with time, with adjustable parameters that include: population exposed; proportion asymptomatic; number of active and recovered cases; infectious period; R0 or doubling time; proportion critically ill; available ICU beds; duration of ICU stay; and uncertainty of projection.    Results: The three-day moving average of the caseload suggested two waves of transmission from Day 0 to 17 (R0=3.32, 95% CI 1.85 - 5.41) and from Day 18 - 30 (R=1.25, 95%CI: 0.93 - 1.63). We estimate that if there are 156 active cases with 91 recovered at the time of lockout, and R increases to 1.5 (doubling time 19 days), under the standard parameters for Sri Lanka, the ICU bed capacity of 300 is likely to be saturated by about 100 days days, signalled by 18 new infections (95% CI 15 - 22) on Day 14 after lockout.   Conclusion: Our model suggests that to ensure that the case load remains within the available capacity of the health system after lockout, transmission should not exceed R=1.5.

{"text": "Extended SIR prediction of the epidemics trend of COVID-19 in Italy and compared with Hunan, China\tBackground: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID19) is currently a global public health threat. Outside of China, Italy is one of the most suffering countries with the COVID19 epidemic. It is important to predict the epidemics trend of COVID19 epidemic in Italy to help develop public health strategies.  Methods: We used time series data of COVID 19 from Jan 22,2020 to Mar 16,2020. An infectious disease dynamic extended susceptible infected removed (eSIR) model, which covers the effects of different intervention measures in dissimilar periods, was applied to estimate the epidemic trend in Italy. The basic reproductive number was estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and presented using the resulting posterior mean and 95% credible interval (CI). Hunan, with similar total number of populations in Italy, was used as a comparative item.   Results: In the eSIR model, we estimated that the basic reproductive number for COVID 19 was respectively 4.10 (95% CI: 2.15 to 6.77) in Italy and 3.15(95% CI: 1.71 to 5.21) in Hunan. There would be totally 30 086 infected cases (95%CI:7920-81 869) under the current country blockade and the endpoint would be Apr 25 (95%CI: Mar 30 to Aug 07) in Italy. If the country blockade is imposed 5 day later, the total number of infected cases would expand the infection scale 1.50 times. Conclusion: Italy's current strict measures can efficaciously prevent the further spread of COVID19 and should be maintained. Necessary strict public health measures be implemented as soon as possible in other European countries with a high number of COVID19 cases.

{"text": "Tuning antiviral CD8 T-cell response via proline-altered peptide ligand vaccination\tViral escape from CD8 + cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses correlates with disease progression and represents a significant challenge for vaccination. Here, we demonstrate that CD8 + T cell recognition of the naturally occurring MHC-I-restricted LCMV-associated immune escape variant Y4F is restored following vaccination with a proline-altered peptide ligand (APL). The APL increases MHC/peptide (pMHC) complex stability, rigidifies the peptide and facilitates T cell receptor (TCR) recognition through reduced entropy costs. Structural analyses of pMHC complexes before and after TCR binding, combined with biophysical analyses, revealed that although the TCR binds similarly to all complexes, the p3P modification alters the conformations of a very limited amount of specific MHC and peptide residues, facilitating efficient TCR recognition. This approach can be easily introduced in peptides restricted to other MHC alleles, and can be combined with currently available and future vaccination protocols in order to prevent viral immune escape. Author Summary Viral escape mutagenesis correlates often with disease progression and represents a major hurdle for vaccination-based therapies. Here, we have designed and developed a novel generation of altered epitopes that re-establish and enhance significantly CD8 + T cell recognition of a naturally occurring viral immune escape variant. Biophysical and structural analyses provide a clear understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying this reestablished recognition. We believe that this approach can be implemented to currently available or novel vaccination approaches to efficiently restore T cell recognition of virus escape variants to control disease progression.", "entities": [{"entity": "Viral escape", "type": "Gene", "start": 84, "end": 96}, {"entity": "Viral escape", "type": "Gene", "start": 1145, "end": 1157}, {"entity": "Y4F", "type": "Gene", "start": 366, "end": 369}, {"entity": "APL", "type": "Disease", "start": 443, "end": 446}, {"entity": "APL", "type": "Disease", "start": 453, "end": 456}, {"entity": "pMHC", "type": "Gene", "start": 480, "end": 484}, {"entity": "pMHC", "type": "Gene", "start": 632, "end": 636}, {"entity": "rigidifies", "type": "Chemical", "start": 505, "end": 515}, {"entity": "peptide", "type": "Gene", "start": 57, "end": 64}, {"entity": "peptide", "type": "Gene", "start": 427, "end": 434}, {"entity": "peptide", "type": "Gene", "start": 471, "end": 478}, {"entity": "peptide", "type": "Gene", "start": 520, "end": 527}, {"entity": "peptide", "type": "Gene", "start": 869, "end": 876}, {"entity": "T cell receptor", "type": "Gene", "start": 544, "end": 559}, {"entity": "TCR", "type": "Gene", "start": 561, "end": 564}, {"entity": "TCR", "type": "Gene", "start": 664, "end": 667}, {"entity": "TCR", "type": "Gene", "start": 740, "end": 743}, {"entity": "TCR", "type": "Gene", "start": 910, "end": 913}, {"entity": "Structural analyses", "type": "Gene", "start": 609, "end": 628}, {"entity": "p3P", "type": "Gene", "start": 782, "end": 785}, {"entity": "alters", "type": "Disease", "start": 799, "end": 805}, {"entity": "MHC", "type": "Gene", "start": 467, "end": 470}, {"entity": "MHC", "type": "Gene", "start": 633, "end": 636}, {"entity": "MHC", "type": "Gene", "start": 861, "end": 864}, {"entity": "MHC", "type": "Gene", "start": 998, "end": 1001}, {"entity": "peptides", "type": "Gene", "start": 969, "end": 977}, {"entity": "structural analyses", "type": "Gene", "start": 1490, "end": 1509}]}

{"text": "Influence of different glycoproteins and of the virion core on SERINC5 antiviral activity\tHost plasma membrane protein SERINC5 is incorporated into budding retrovirus particles where it blocks subsequent entry into susceptible target cells. Three accessory proteins encoded by diverse retroviruses, HIV-1 Nef, EIAV S2, and MLV Glycogag, each independently disrupt SERINC5 antiviral activity, by redirecting SERINC5 from the site of virion assembly on the plasma membrane to an internal RAB7 + endosomal compartment. Pseudotyping retroviruses with particular glycoproteins, e.g., the vesicular stomatitis glycoprotein (VSV G), renders the infectivity of particles resistant to inhibition by virion-associated SERINC5. To better understand viral determinants for SERINC5-sensitivity, the effect of SERINC5 was assessed using HIV-1, MLV, and M-PMV virion cores, pseudotyped with glycoproteins from Arenavirus, Coronavirus, Filovirus, Rhabdovirus, Paramyxovirus, and Orthomyxovirus genera. Infectivity of particles, pseudotyped with HIV-1, amphotropic-MLV, or influenza virus glycoproteins, was decreased by SERINC5, whether the core was provided by HIV-1, MLV, or M-PMV. Particles generated by all three cores, and pseudotyped with glycoproteins from either avian leukosis virus-A, human endogenous retrovirus K (HERV-K), ecotropic-MLV, HTLV-1, Measles morbillivirus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis mammarenavirus (LCMV), Marburg virus, Ebola virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV), or VSV, were insensitive to SERINC5. In contrast, particles pseudotyped with M-PMV, RD114, or rabies virus (RABV) glycoproteins were sensitive to SERINC5, but only with particular retroviral cores. Resistance to SERINC5 by particular glycoproteins did not correlate with reduced SERINC5 incorporation into particles or with the route of viral entry. These findings indicate that some non-retroviruses may be sensitive to SERINC5 and that, in addition to the viral glycoprotein, the retroviral core influences sensitivity to SERINC5. IMPORTANCE The importance of SERINC5 for inhibition of retroviruses is underscored by convergent evolution among three non-monophyletic retroviruses, each of which encodes a structurally unrelated SERINC5 inhibitor. One of these retroviruses causes tumors in mice, a second anemia in horses, and a third causes AIDS. SERINC5 is incorporated into retrovirus particles where it blocks entry into target cells, via a mechanism that is dependent on the viral glycoprotein. Here we demonstrate that retroviruses pseudotyped with glycoproteins from several non-retroviruses are also inhibited by SERINC5, suggesting that enveloped viruses other than retroviruses may also be inhibited by SERINC5. Additionally, we found that sensitivity to SERINC5 is determined by the retrovirus core, as well as by the glycoprotein. By better understanding how SERINC5 inhibits viruses we hope to extend fundamental understanding of virus replication and of the native role of SERINC5 in cells, and perhaps to advance the development of new antiviral strategies.", "entities": [{"entity": "glycoproteins", "type": "Drug", "start": 23, "end": 36}, {"entity": "glycoproteins", "type": "Drug", "start": 558, "end": 571}, {"entity":

{"text": "Mutations, Recombination and Insertion in the Evolution of 2019-nCoV\tBackground The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV or SARS-CoV-2) has spread more rapidly than any other betacoronavirus including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. However, the mechanisms responsible for infection and molecular evolution of this virus remained unclear. Methods We collected and analyzed 120 genomic sequences of 2019-nCoV including 11 novel genomes from patients in China. Through comprehensive analysis of the available genome sequences of 2019-nCoV strains, we have tracked multiple inheritable SNPs and determined the evolution of 2019-nCoV relative to other coronaviruses. Results Systematic analysis of 120 genomic sequences of 2019-nCoV revealed co-circulation of two genetic subgroups with distinct SNPs markers, which can be used to trace the 2019-nCoV spreading pathways to different regions and countries. Although 2019-nCoV, human and bat SARS-CoV share high homologous in overall genome structures, they evolved into two distinct groups with different receptor entry specificities through potential recombination in the receptor binding regions. In addition, 2019-nCoV has a unique four amino acid insertion between S1 and S2 domains of the spike protein, which created a potential furin or TMPRSS2 cleavage site. Conclusions Our studies provided comprehensive insights into the evolution and spread of the 2019-nCoV.

Methods.The ChiCTR database was comprehensively searched, and the COVID-19 research registration information as of February 24, 2020 was counted. Descriptive analysis of registration time trends and geographical distribution. Chi-square test was used to compare the statistical differences between different study types, intervention methods, research phases and major sponsors. Frequency studies were used to analyze the characteristics of CMT and BI therapy. Results.232 COVID-19 studies registered at the ChiCTR Center were collected. The overall number of COVID-19 registrations was increased. Hubei Province, China has the largest number of registrations, followed by Guangdong, Zhejiang and Sichuan. There were significant differences between the number of participants (P=0.000), study duration (P=0.008), study assignment (P=0.000), and blind method (P=0.000) for different study types. Significant differences could be seen in the dimensions of multicenter study(P=0.022), of participants numbe(P=0.000), study duration(P=0.000) and study assignment(P=0.001) for the four intervention methods. There were significant differences in study assignment (P=0.043) between the early and late studies. CMT drugs with high research frequency are chloroquine, lopinavir / ritonavir, and I-IFN, which are all in phase 4; BI was Cell therapy, plasma therapy, Thymosin, and M/P-AB, which are all in early stages. Conclusion.There were problems of unclear classification of research types and irregular registration behavior. Also, within the studies researched, heterogeneity exists for various dimensions.

We execute a comprehensive in silico analysis of viral peptide-MHC class I binding affinity across all known HLA -A, -B, and -C genotypes for all SARS-CoV-2 peptides. We further explore the potential for cross-protective immunity conferred by prior exposure to four common human coronaviruses. The SARS-CoV-2 proteome is successfully sampled and presented by a diversity of HLA alleles.

{"text": "A spatial model of CoVID-19 transmission in England and Wales: early spread and peak timing\tBackground: An outbreak of a novel coronavirus, named CoVID-19, was first reported in China on 31 December 2019. As of 9 February 2020, cases have been reported in 25 countries, including probable cases of human-to-human transmission in England.    Methods: We adapted an existing national-scale metapopulation model to capture the spread of CoVID-19 in England and Wales. We used 2011 census data to capture population sizes and population movement, together with parameter estimates from the current outbreak in China.   Results:  We predict that a CoVID-19 outbreak will peak 126 to 147 days (~4 months) after the start of person-to-person transmission in England and Wales in the absence of controls, assuming biological parameters remain unchanged. Therefore, if person-to-person transmission persists from February, we predict the epidemic peak would occur in June. The starting location has minimal impact on peak timing, and model stochasticity varies peak timing by 10 days. Incorporating realistic parameter uncertainty leads to estimates of peak time ranging from 78 days to 241 days after person-to-person transmission has been established.  Seasonal changes in transmission rate substantially impact the timing and size of the epidemic peak, as well as the total attack rate.   Discussion: We provide initial estimates of the potential course of CoVID-19 in England and Wales in the absence of control measures. These results can be refined with improved estimates of epidemiological parameters, and permit investigation of control measures and cost effectiveness analyses.

The need for IgG/IgM combined antibody test is booming, but data on diagnostic indexes evaluation was inadequate. The aim of this study was to evaluate diagnostic indexes of a rapid IgG/IgM combined antibody test for SARS-CoV-2. Methods A total of 179 patients were enrolled. Serum were collected for IgG-IgM combined antibody test and corresponding nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens were collected for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. According to SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results, patients under study were categorized as PCR positive group in 90 patients and PCR negative group in 89 patients. Results 1. Of the 90 PCR positive samples, 77 were tested positive by SARS-CoV-2 IgG-IgM test kit, yielding a sensitivity of 85.6%. Meanwhile, of the 89 PCR negative sample, 8 samples were detected positive, resulting in a specificity of 91%. Positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy of this test kit was 95.1%, 82.7%, and 88.3%, respectively. Kappa efficiency between IgG/IgM test kit and RT-PCR were 0.75. 2. Accuracy in mild/common and severe/critical subgroup were 73.9% and 97.7%, respectively. Accuracy in clinical confirmed, suspected cases and other disease subgroups were 70%, 60%, and 100%, respectively. 3. Patients were further divided into 0-7, 8-15 and >= 16 groups according to the time from illness onset to sample collection.

{"text": "Receptor binding and proteolysis do not induce large conformational changes in the SARS-CoV spike\tSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged in 2002 as a highly transmissible pathogenic human betacoronavirus. The viral spike glycoprotein (S) utilizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a host protein receptor and mediates fusion of the viral and host membranes, making S essential to viral entry into host cells and host species tropism. As SARS-CoV enters host cells, the viral S undergoes two proteolytic cleavages at S1/S2 and S2’ sites necessary for efficient membrane fusion. Here, we present a cryo-EM analysis of the trimeric SARS-CoV S interactions with ACE2 and of the trypsin-cleaved S. Surprisingly, neither binding to ACE2 nor cleavage by trypsin at the S1/S2 cleavage site impart large conformational changes within S or expose the secondary cleavage site, S2’.

{"text": "How to make more from exposure data? An integrated machine learning pipeline to predict pathogen exposure\tPredicting infectious disease dynamics is a central challenge in disease ecology. Models that can assess which individuals are most at risk of being exposed to a pathogen not only provide valuable insights into disease transmission and dynamics but can also guide management interventions. Constructing such models for wild animal populations, however, is particularly challenging; often only serological data is available on a subset of individuals and non-linear relationships between variables are common. Here we take advantage of the latest advances in statistical machine learning to construct pathogen-risk models that automatically incorporate complex non-linear relationships with minimal statistical assumptions from ecological data with missing values. Our approach compares multiple machine learning algorithms in a unified environment to find the model with the best predictive performance and uses game theory to better interpret results. We apply this framework on two major pathogens that infect African lions: canine distemper virus (CDV) and feline parvovirus. Our modelling approach provided enhanced predictive performance compared to more traditional approaches, as well as new insights into disease risks in a wild population. We were able to efficiently capture and visualise strong non-linear patterns, as well as model complex interactions between variables in shaping exposure risk from CDV and feline parvovirus. For example, we found that lions were more likely to be exposed to CDV at a young age but only in low rainfall years. When combined with our data calibration approach, our framework helped us to answer questions about risk of pathogen exposure which are difficult to address with previous methods. Our framework not only has the potential to aid in predicting disease risk in animal populations, but also can be used to build robust predictive models suitable for other ecological applications such as modelling species distribution or diversity patterns.", "entities": [{"entity": "infectious disease", "type": "Disease", "start": 117, "end": 135}, {"entity": "distemper virus", "type": "Virus", "start": 1140, "end": 1155}, {"entity": "feline parvovirus", "type": "Virus", "start": 1166, "end": 1183}, {"entity": "feline parvovirus", "type": "Virus", "start": 1527, "end": 1544}, {"entity": "young age", "type": "Disease", "start": 1622, "end": 1631}, {"entity": "rainfall", "type": "Organization", "start": 1648, "end": 1656}]}

{"text": "Implementation of a Novel Remote Physician SBRT Coverage Process during the Coronavirus Pandemic\tINTRODUCTION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, alternative methods of care are needed to reduce the relative risk of transmission in departments. Also needed is the ability to provide vital radiation oncological care if radiation oncologists (RO) are reallocated to other departments. We implemented a novel remote RO SBRT coverage practice, requiring it to be reliable, of high audio and visual quality, timely, and the same level of specialty care as our current in-person treatment coverage practice.  METHODS: All observed failure modes were recorded during implementation over the first 15 sequential fractions. The time from CBCT to treatment was calculated before and after implementation to determine timeliness of remote coverage. Image quality metrics were calculated between the imaging console screen and the RO′s shared screen. Comfort levels with audio/visual communication as well as overall comfort in comparison to in-person RO coverage was evaluated using Likert scale surveys after treatment. RESULTS: Remote RO SBRT coverage was successfully implemented in 14/15 fractions with 3 observed process failures that were all corrected before treatment. Average times of pre-treatment coverage before and after implementation were 8.74 and 8.51min, respectively. The cross correlation between the imaging console screen and RO′s shared screen was r=0.96 and lag was 0.05s. The average value for all survey questions was above 4.5, approaching in-person RO coverage comfort levels. CONCLUSIONS: Our novel method of remote RO SBRT coverage permits reduced personnel and patient interactions surrounding RT procedures.

This study is aimed to investigate the risk perception and immediate psychological state of HCWs in the early stage of the COVID-19 epidemic.  Methods This study utilized a cross-sectional survey designed on a convenient sample of 4357 HCWs in China. Its data were collected using anonymous structured questionnaires distributed through social software. 6 questions were set to evaluate the participants' risk perception of COVID-19, and a General Health Questionnaire was used to identify the participants' immediate psychological status. Descriptive statistics were used for data analysis. Risk perception and psychological status were compared by demographic characteristics and COVID-19 exposure experiences. Result A total of 4,600 questionnaires were distributed, and 4,357 qualified ones (94.7%) were collected. The main concerns of HCWs are: infection of colleagues (72.5%), infection of family members (63.9%), protective measures (52.3%) and medical violence (48.5%). And 39.1% of the HCWs had psychological distress, especially working in Wuhan, participating in frontline treatments, having been isolated and having family members or colleagues infected.

{"text": "Flattening the curve before it flattens us: hospital critical care capacity limits and mortality from novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV2) cases in US counties\tABSTRACT Background As of March 26, 2020, the United States had the highest number of confirmed cases of Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) of any country in the world. Hospital critical care is perhaps the most important medical system choke point in terms of preventing deaths in a disaster scenario such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. We therefore brought together previously established disease modeling estimates of the growth of the COVID-19 epidemic in the US under various social distancing contact reduction assumptions, with local estimates of the potential critical care surge response across all US counties. Methods Estimates of spatio-temporal COVID-19 demand and medical system critical care supply were calculated for all continental US counties. These estimates were statistically summarized and mapped for US counties, regions and urban versus non-urban areas. Estimates of COVID-19 infections and patients needing critical care were calculated from March 24, 2020 to April 24, 2020 for three different estimated population levels - 0%, 25%, and 50% - of contact reduction (through actions such as social distancing). Multiple national public and private datasets were linked and harmonized in order to calculate county-level critical care bed counts that included currently available beds and those that could be made available under four surge response scenarios - very low, low, medium, and high - as well as excess deaths stemming from inaccessible critical care. Results Surge response scenarios ranged from a very low total supply 77,588 critical care beds to a high total of 278,850 critical care beds. Over the four week study period, excess deaths from inaccessible critical care ranged from 24,688 in the very low response scenario to 13,268 in the high response scenario. Northeastern and urban counties were projected to be most affected by excess deaths due to critical care shortages, and counties in New York, Colorado, and Virginia were projected to exceed their critical care bed limits despite high levels of COVID-19 contact reduction. Over the four week study period, an estimated 12,203-19,594 excess deaths stemming from inaccessible critical care could be averted through greater preventive actions such as travel restrictions, publicly imposed contact precautions, greater availability of rapid testing for COVID-19, social distancing, self-isolation when sick, and similar interventions. An estimated 4,029-11,420 excess deaths stemming from inaccessible critical care could be averted through aggressive critical care surge response and preparations, including high clearance of ICU and non-ICU critical care beds and extraordinary measures like using a single ventilator for multiple patients. Conclusions Unless the epidemic curve of COVID-19 cases is flattened over an extended period of time, the US COVID-19 epidemic will cause a shortage of critical care beds and drive up otherwise preventable deaths. The findings here support value of preventive actions to flatten the epidemic curve, as well as the value of exercising extraordinary surge capacity measures to increase access to hospital critical care for severely ill COVID-19 patients.", "entities": [{"entity": "coronavirus", "type": "Virus", "start": 108, "end": 119}, {"entity": "Coronavirus", "type": "Virus", "start": 264, "end": 275}, {"entity": "COVID-19", "type": "Disease", "start": 277, "end": 285}, {"entity": "COVID-19", "type": "Disease", "start": 469, "end": 477}, {"entity": "COVID-19", "type": "Disease", "start": 589, "end": 597}, {"entity": "COVID-19", "type": "Disease", "start": 808, "end": 816}, {"entity": "COVID-19", "type": "Disease", "start": 1042, "end": 1050}, {"entity": "COVID-19", "type": "Disease", "start": 2195, "end": 2203}, {"entity": "COVID-19", "type": "Disease", "start": 2499, "end": 2507}, {"entity": "COVID-19", "type": "Disease", "start": 2930, "end": 2938}, {"entity": "COVID-19", "type": "Disease", "start": 2998, "end": 3006}, {"entity": "COVID-19", "type": "Disease", "start": 3323, "end": 3331}, {"entity": "sick", "type": "Phenotype", "start": 2548, "end": 2552}]}

{"text": "Comparisons of a Novel Air Sampling Filter Material, Wash Buffers and Extraction Methods in the Detection and Quantification of Influenza Virus\tQuantification of aerosolized influenza virus is used for determining inhalation exposure. Several bioaerosol samplers and analytical methods have been used; however, the detection and quantification of influenza virus among aerosol samples remains challenging. Therefore, improved viral aerosol measurement methods are needed. This study evaluated influenza virus recovery among three filter types polytetrafluoroethylene, polyvinylchloride and polystyrene. Polytetrafluoroethylene, polyvinylchloride are fabricated filter materials and commonly used in the scientific literature to sample for viral aerosols. A novel, electrospun polystyrene filter material may improve viral aerosol recovery during filter-based air sampling. The filter materials were compared across the following conditions: treated with or without air, filter wash buffer (HBSS or PBS), and viral RNA extraction method (QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit or Trizol). Twenty trials were completed in a chamber and samples were analyzed using RT-qPCR. Viral recovery was significantly different (p-value < .0001) by filter type. Polystyrene filter use resulted in recovery of the most viral RNA. Air sampling did not affect the recovery of viral RNA from the filter materials (p-values > 0.05). Viral RNA concentrations were significantly different across extraction methods for all comparisons (p-values < 0.05).

The fast and relentless spread nCOVID-19 has basically segmented the populace only into merely into three classes, such as susceptible, infected and recovered compartments. Adapting the classical SEIR- type epidemic modelling framework, the direct person-to-person contact transmission is taken as the direct route of transmission of nCOVID-19 pandemic. In this research, the authors have developed a model of the nation-wide trends of the outburst of the nCOVID-19 infection using an SEIR Model. The SEIR dynamics are expressed using ordinary differential equations. The creators initially determined the parameters of the model from the accessible day by day information for Indian States dependent on around 35 days history of diseases, recuperation and deaths. The determined parameters have been amassed to extend future patterns for the Indian subcontinent, which is right now at a beginning time in the contamination cycle. The novelty of the study lies in the prediction of both the pessimistic and optimistic mathematical model based comprehensive analysis of nCOVID-19 infection spreading, for two different conditions: (a) if lock down gets withdrawn and (b) if lock down continues as a whole. If the complete lock down in India is withdrawn on 14th April 2020, as a whole, then from the simulation, the authors have predicted that the infected population will flare-up to a large extent , suddenly, however, gradual or zone specific withdrawal would be more effective solution. This study also suggested some possible way-out to get rid of this situation by providing a trade-off between \"flattening of the curve\" as well as less economic turbulence.

Moreover, intravenous delivery of IMRCs inhibits both pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis in mouse models of lung injury, and significantly improves the survival rate of the recipient mice in a dose-dependent manner, likely through their paracrine functions.

We develop a compartmental model for assessing the community-wide impact of mask use by the general, asymptomatic public, a portion of which may be asymptomatically infectious.  Model simulations, using data relevant to COVID-19 dynamics in the US states of New York and Washington, suggest that broad adoption of even relatively ineffective face masks may meaningfully reduce community transmission of COVID-19 and decrease peak hospitalizations and deaths.  Moreover, mask use decreases the effective transmission rate in nearly linear proportion to the product of mask effectiveness (as a fraction of potentially infectious contacts blocked) and coverage rate (as a fraction of the general population), while the impact on epidemiologic outcomes (death, hospitalizations) is highly nonlinear, indicating masks could synergize with other non-pharmaceutical measures.  Notably, masks are found to be useful with respect to both preventing illness in healthy persons and preventing asymptomatic transmission.  Hypothetical mask adoption scenarios, for Washington and New York state, suggest that immediate near universal (80%) adoption of moderately (50%) effective masks could prevent on the order of 17--45% of projected deaths over two months in New York, while decreasing the peak daily death rate by 34--58%, absent other changes in epidemic dynamics.  Even very weak masks (20% effective) can still be useful if the underlying transmission rate is relatively low or decreasing: In Washington, where baseline transmission is much less intense, 80% adoption of such masks could reduce mortality by 24--65% (and peak deaths 15--69%), compared to 2--9% mortality reduction in New York (peak death reduction 9--18%). Our results suggest use of face masks by the general public is potentially of high value in curtailing community transmission and the burden of the pandemic.   The community-wide benefits are likely to be greatest when face masks are used in conjunction with other non-pharmaceutical practices (such as social-distancing), and when adoption is nearly universal (nation-wide) and compliance is high.", "entities": [{"entity": "COVID-19", "type": "Disease", "start": 102, "end": 110}, {"entity": "COVID-19", "type": "Disease", "start": 187, "end": 195}, {"entity": "COVID-19", "type": "Disease", "start": 540, "end": 548}, {"entity": "COVID-19", "type": "Disease", "start": 723, "end": 731}, {"entity": "weak", "type": "Phenotype", "start": 1688, "end": 1692}, {"entity": "nation-wide", "type": "Chemical", "start": 2400, "end": 2411}]}

To better understand the initial step of infection at atomic-level, we determined the crystal structure of the 2019-nCoV spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) bound with the cell receptor ACE2 at 2.45 Å resolution. The overall ACE2-binding mode of the 2019-nCoV RBD is nearly identical to that of the SARS-CoV RBD, which also utilizes ACE2 as the cell receptor. Structural analysis identified residues in 2019-nCoV RBD critical for ACE2 binding, and majority of which are either highly conserved or shared similar side chain properties with those in the SARS-CoV RBD. Such similarity in structure and sequence strongly argue for a convergent evolution between 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV RBD for improved binding to ACE2 despite of being segregated in different genetic lineages in the betacoronavirus genus. The epitopes of two SARS-CoV antibodies targeting the RBD are also analyzed with the 2019-nCoV RBD, providing insights into future identification of cross-reactive antibodies.", "entities": [{"entity": "ACE2 receptor", "type": "Gene", "start": 80, "end": 93}, {"entity": "2019-nCoV", "type": "Virus", "start": 25, "end": 34}, {"entity": "2019-nCoV", "type": "Virus", "start": 137, "end": 146}, {"entity": "2019-nCoV", "type": "Virus", "start": 423, "end": 432}, {"entity": "2019-nCoV", "type": "Virus", "start": 562, "end": 571}, {"entity": "2019-nCoV", "type": "Virus", "start": 715, "end": 724}, {"entity": "2019-nCoV", "type": "Virus", "start": 970, "end": 979}, {"entity": "2019-nCoV", "type": "Virus", "start": 1199, "end": 1208}, {"entity": "spilled", "type": "Chemical", "start": 262, "end": 269}, {"entity": "RBD", "type": "Gene", "start": 464, "end": 467}, {"entity": "RBD", "type": "Gene", "start": 572, "end": 575}, {"entity": "RBD", "type": "Gene", "start": 620, "end": 623}, {"entity": "RBD", "type": "Gene", "start": 725, "end": 728}, {"entity": "RBD", "type": "Gene", "start": 873, "end": 876}, {"entity": "RBD", "type": "Gene", "start": 993, "end": 996}, {"entity": "RBD", "type": "Gene", "start": 1168, "end": 1171}, {"entity": "RBD", "type": "Gene", "start": 1209, "end": 1212}, {"entity": "ACE2", "type": "Gene", "start": 498, "end": 502}, {"entity": "ACE2", "type": "Gene", "start": 645, "end": 649}, {"entity": "ACE2", "type": "Gene", "start": 742, "end": 746}, {"entity": "ACE2", "type": "Gene", "start": 1021, "end": 1025}, {"entity": "SARS-CoV", "type": "Virus", "start": 611, "end": 619}, {"entity": "SARS-CoV", "type": "Virus", "start": 864, "end": 872}, {"entity": "SARS-CoV", "type": "Virus", "start": 984, "end": 992}, {"entity": "SARS-CoV", "type": "Virus", "start": 1134, "end": 1142}, {"entity": "betacoronavirus genus", "type": "Virus", "start": 1091, "end": 1112}]}

The symptoms of COVID-19 range from mild to severe conditions. However, the physiological changes associated with COVID-19 are barely understood. In this study, we performed targeted metabolomic and lipidomic analyses of plasma from a cohort of COVID-19 patients who had experienced different symptoms. We found the metabolite and lipid alterations exhibit apparent correlation with the course of disease in these COVID-19 patients, indicating that the development of COVID-19 affected whole-body metabolism of the patients. In particular, malic acid of the TCA cycle and carbamoyl phosphate of urea cycle reveal the altered energy metabolism and hepatic dysfunction, respectively. It should be noted that carbamoyl phosphate is profoundly down-regulated in fatal patients compared with mild patients. And more importantly, guanosine monophosphate (GMP), which is mediated by not only GMP synthase but also CD39 and CD73, is significantly changed between healthy subjects and COVID-19 patients, as well as between the mild and fatal groups. In addition, the dyslipidaemia was observed in COVID-19 patients. Overall, the disturbed metabolic patterns have been found to align with the progress and severity of COVID-19.

{"text": "A Web-based, Mobile Responsive Application to Screen Healthcare Workers for COVID Symptoms: Descriptive Study\tBackground: The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted over 1 million people across the globe, with over 330,000 cases in the United States.  To help limit the spread in Massachusetts, the Department of Public Health required that all healthcare workers must be screened for symptoms daily - individuals with symptoms may not work.  We rapidly created a digital COVID-19 symptom screening tool for a large, academic, integrated healthcare delivery system, Partners HealthCare, in Boston, Massachusetts.     Objective: We describe the design and development of the COVID-19 symptom screening application and report on aggregate usage data from the first week of use across the organization.  Methods: Using agile principles, we designed, tested and implemented a solution over the span of a week using progressively custom development approaches as the requirements and use case become more solidified.  We developed the minimum viable product (MVP) of a mobile responsive, web-based self-service application using REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture).  For employees without access to a computer or mobile device to use the self-service application, we established a manual process where in-person, socially distanced screeners asked employees entering the site if they have symptoms and then manually recorded the responses in an Office 365 Form.  A custom .NET Framework application was developed solution as COVID Pass was scaled.  We collected log data from the .NET application, REDCap and Office 365 from the first week of full enterprise deployment (March 30, 2020 - April 5, 2020).  Aggregate descriptive statistics including overall employee attestations by day and site, employee attestations by application method (COVID Pass automatic screening vs. manual screening), employee attestations by time of day, and percentage of employees reporting COVID-19 symptoms  Results: We rapidly created the MVP and gradually deployed it across the hospitals in our organization.  By the end of the first week of enterprise deployment, the screening application was being used by over 25,000 employees each weekday. Over the first full week of deployment, 154,730 employee attestation logs were processed across the system.  Over this 7-day period, 558 (0.36%) employees reported positive symptoms.  In most clinical locations, the majority of employees (~80-90%) used the self-service application, with a smaller percentage (~10-20%) using manual attestation.  Hospital staff continued to work around the clock, but as expected, staff attestations peaked during shift changes between 7-8am, 2-3pm, 4-6pm, and 11pm-midnight.

Further, we have identified over 500 symptomatic employees that otherwise would have possibly come to work, potentially putting others at risk.

Standard epidemic models provide a theoretically well-founded description of dynamics of disease incidence. For COVID-19 with infectiousness peaking before and at symptom onset, the SEIR model explains the hidden build-up of exposed individuals which challenges containment strategies, in particular, due to delayed epidemic responses to non-pharmaceutical interventions. However, spatial heterogeneity questions the adequacy of modeling epidemic outbreaks on the level of a whole country. Here we show that sequential data assimilation of a stochastic version of the standard SEIR epidemic model captures dynamical behavior of outbreaks on the regional level. Such regional modeling of epidemics with relatively low numbers of infected and realistic demographic noise accounts for both spatial heterogeneity and stochasticity. Based on adapted regional models, population level short-term predictions can be achieved. More realistic epidemic models that include spatial heterogeneity are within reach via sequential data assimilation methods.", "entities": [{"entity": "COVID-19", "type": "Disease", "start": 80, "end": 88}, {"entity": "COVID-19", "type": "Disease", "start": 128, "end": 136}, {"entity": "COVID-19", "type": "Disease", "start": 365, "end": 373}, {"entity": "society", "type": "Organization", "start": 244, "end": 251}, {"entity": "symptom", "type": "Phenotype", "start": 416, "end": 423}, {"entity": "spatial", "type": "Gene", "start": 634, "end": 641}, {"entity": "spatial", "type": "Gene", "start": 1040, "end": 1047}, {"entity": "spatial", "type": "Gene", "start": 1216, "end": 1223}]}

Design Multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled trial. Setting 16 government-designated COVID-19 treatment centers in China through 11 to 29 in February 2020. Participants 150 patients hospitalized with COVID-19. 75 patients were assigned to HCQ plus SOC and 75 were assigned to SOC alone (control group). Interventions HCQ was administrated with a loading dose of 1, 200 mg daily for three days followed by a maintained dose of 800 mg daily for the remaining days (total treatment duration: 2 or 3 weeks for mild/moderate or severe patients, respectively). Main outcome measures The primary endpoint was the 28-day negative conversion rate of SARS-CoV-2. The assessed secondary endpoints were negative conversion rate at day 4, 7, 10, 14 or 21, the improvement rate of clinical symptoms within 28-day, normalization of C-reactive protein and blood lymphocyte count within 28-day. Primary and secondary analysis was by intention to treat. Adverse events were assessed in the safety population.  Results The overall 28-day negative conversion rate was not different between SOC plus HCQ and SOC group (Kaplan-Meier estimates 85.4% versus 81.3%, P=0.341). Negative conversion rate at day 4, 7, 10, 14 or 21 was also similar between the two groups. No different 28-day symptoms alleviation rate was observed between the two groups. A significant efficacy of HCQ on alleviating symptoms was observed when the confounding effects of anti-viral agents were removed in the post-hoc analysis (Hazard ratio, 8.83, 95%CI, 1.09 to 71.3). This was further supported by a significantly greater reduction of CRP (6.986 in SOC plus HCQ versus 2.723 in SOC, milligram/liter, P=0.045) conferred by the addition of HCQ, which also led to more rapid recovery of lymphopenia, albeit no statistical significance. Adverse events were found in 8.8% of SOC and 30% of HCQ recipients with two serious adverse events. The most common adverse event in the HCQ recipients was diarrhea (10%). Conclusions The administration of HCQ did not result in a higher negative conversion rate but more alleviation of clinical symptoms than SOC alone in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 without receiving antiviral treatment, possibly through anti-inflammatory effects. Adverse events were significantly increased in HCQ recipients but no apparently increase of serious adverse events.

{"text": "Social distancing to slow the U.S. COVID-19 epidemic: an interrupted time-series analysis\tBackground: Social distancing measures to address the U.S. COVID-19 epidemic may have significant health, social, and economic impacts.  Objective: To estimate the mean change in state-level COVID-19 epidemic growth before versus after the implementation of statewide social distancing measures.  Design: Interrupted time-series analysis.  Setting: United States. Measurements: Our primary exposure was time in relation to implementation of the first statewide social distancing measure. The pre-implementation period began 14 days prior to implementation and included up to 3 days after implementation to account for incubation. Post-implementation began 4 days after, up to and including March 30. Our primary outcome was the COVID-19 growth rate, calculated as the log of daily COVID-19 cases minus the log of daily COVID-19 cases on the prior day. Results: All states applied some form of statewide social distancing between March 10-27. The mean daily COVID-19 growth rate decreased beginning four days after implementation of the first statewide social distancing measures, by an additional 0.8% per day; 95% CI, -1.4% to -0.2%; P=0.002). This reduction corresponds to an increase in doubling time of the epidemic from 3.3 days (before) to 5.0 days (at 14 days after implementation). Limitations: Potential bias due to the aggregate nature of the ecological data, potential confounding by contemporaneous changes (e.g., increases in testing), and potential underestimation of social distancing due to spillovers across neighboring states.  Conclusion: Statewide social distancing measures were associated with a decrease in U.S. COVID-19 epidemic growth.

{"text": "Real-time, MinION-based, amplicon sequencing for lineage typing of infectious bronchitis virus from upper respiratory samples\tInfectious bronchitis (IB) causes significant economic losses in the global poultry industry. Control of infectious bronchitis is hindered by the genetic diversity of the causative agent, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), which has led to the emergence of several serotypes that lack complete serologic cross-protection. While serotyping by definition requires immunologic characterization, genotyping is an efficient means to identify IBVs detected in samples. Sanger sequencing of the S1 subunit of the spike gene is currently used to genotype IBV; however, the universal S1 PCR was created to work from cultured IBV and it is inefficient at detecting mixed isolates. This paper describes a MinION-based AmpSeq method that genetically typed IBV from clinical samples, including samples with multiple isolates. Total RNA was extracted from fifteen tracheal scrapings and choanal cleft swab samples, randomly reverse transcribed, and PCR amplified using modified S1-targeted primers. Amplicons were barcoded to allow for pooling of samples, processed per manufacturer’s instructions into a 1D MinION sequencing library, and sequenced on the MinION. The AmpSeq method detected IBV in 13 of 14 IBV-positive samples. AmpSeq accurately detected and genotyped both IBV lineages in three of five samples containing two IBV lineages. Additionally, one sample contained three IBV lineages, and AmpSeq accurately detected two of the three. Strain identification, including detection of different strains from the same lineage, was also possible with this AmpSeq method. The results demonstrate the feasibility of using MinION-based AmpSeq for rapid and accurate identification and lineage typing of IBV from oral swab samples.", "entities": [{"entity": "infectious bronchitis virus", "type": "Virus", "start": 67, "end": 94}, {"entity": "infectious bronchitis virus", "type": "Virus", "start": 314, "end": 341}, {"entity": "Infectious bronchitis", "type": "Disease", "start": 126, "end": 147}, {"entity": "infectious bronchitis", "type": "Disease", "start": 231, "end": 252}, {"entity": "IBV", "type": "Gene", "start": 343, "end": 346}, {"entity": "IBV", "type": "Gene", "start": 673, "end": 676}, {"entity": "IBV", "type": "Gene", "start": 742, "end": 745}, {"entity": "IBV", "type": "Gene", "start": 870, "end": 873}, {"entity": "IBV", "type": "Gene", "start": 1303, "end": 1306}, {"entity": "IBV", "type": "Gene", "start": 1387, "end": 1390}, {"entity": "IBV", "type": "Gene", "start": 1440, "end": 1443}, {"entity": "IBV", "type": "Gene", "start": 1495, "end": 1498}, {"entity": "IBV", "type": "Gene", "start": 1817, "end": 1820}, {"entity": "IBVs", "type": "Chemical", "start": 563, "end": 567}, {"entity": "genetically", "type": "Gene", "start": 852, "end": 863}, {"entity": "strains", "type": "Disease", "start": 1614, "end": 1621}]}
{"text": "Realtime 2-5A kinetics suggests interferons β and λ evade global arrest of translation by RNase L\tCells of all mammals recognize double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) as a foreign material. In response, they release interferons (IFNs) and activate a ubiquitously expressed pseudokinase/endoribonuclease RNase L. RNase L executes regulated RNA decay and halts global translation. Here we developed a biosensor for 2’,5’-oligoadenylate (2-5A), the natural activator of RNase L. We found that 2-5A was acutely synthesized by cells in response to dsRNA sensing, which immediately triggered cellular RNA cleavage by RNase L and arrested host protein synthesis. However, translation-arrested cells still transcribed IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) and secreted IFNs of types I and III (IFN-β and IFN-λ). Our data suggests that IFNs escape from the action of RNase L on translation. We propose that 2-5A/RNase L pathway serves to rapidly and accurately suppress basal protein synthesis, preserving privileged production of defense proteins of the innate immune system. Significance RNase L is a mammalian enzyme that can stop global protein synthesis during interferon response. Cells must balance the need to make interferons (which are proteins) with the risk to lose cell-wide translation due to RNase L. This balance can most simply be achieved if RNase L was activated late in the interferon response. However, we show by engineering a biosensor for the RNase L pathway, that on the contrary, RNase L activation precedes interferon synthesis. Further, translation of interferons evades the action of RNase L. Our data suggest that RNase L facilitates a switch of protein synthesis from homeostasis to specific needs of innate immune signaling.", "entities": [{"entity": "interferons β", "type": "Gene", "start": 32, "end": 45}, {"entity": "RNase L", "type": "Gene", "start": 90, "end": 97}, {"entity": "RNase L", "type": "Gene", "start": 293, "end": 300}, {"entity": "RNase L", "type": "Gene", "start": 302, "end": 309}, {"entity": "RNase L", "type": "Gene", "start": 457, "end": 464}, {"entity": "RNase L", "type": "Gene", "start": 601, "end": 608}, {"entity": "RNase L", "type": "Gene", "start": 838, "end": 845}, {"entity": "RNase L", "type": "Gene", "start": 883, "end": 890}, {"entity": "RNase L", "type": "Gene", "start": 1061, "end": 1068}, {"entity": "RNase L", "type": "Gene", "start": 1278, "end": 1285}, {"entity": "RNase L", "type": "Gene", "start": 1331, "end": 1338}, {"entity": "RNase L", "type": "Gene", "start": 1438, "end": 1445}, {"entity": "RNase L", "type": "Gene", "start": 1477, "end": 1484}, {"entity": "RNase L", "type": "Gene", "start": 1584, "end": 1591}, {"entity": "RNase L", "type": "Gene", "start": 1615, "end": 1622}, {"entity": "double-stranded RNA", "type": "Gene", "start": 129, "end": 148}, {"entity": "dsRNA", "type": "Gene", "start": 150, "end": 155}, {"entity": "dsRNA", "type": "Gene", "start": 533, "end": 538}, {"entity": "interferons", "type": "Gene", "start": 206, "end": 217}, {"entity": "interferons", "type": "Gene", "start": 1194, "end": 1205}, {"entity": "interferons", "type": "Gene", "start": 1551, "end": 1562}, {"entity": "IFNs", "type": "Gene", "start": 219, "end": 223}, {"entity": "IFNs", "type": "Gene", "start": 741, "end": 745}, {"entity": "IFNs", "type": "Gene", "start": 807, "end": 811}, {"entity": "RNA", "type": "Gene", "start": 152, "end": 155}, {"entity": "RNA", "type": "Gene", "start": 329, "end": 332}, {"entity": "RNA", "type": "Gene", "start": 585, "end": 588}, {"entity": "IFN-stimulated genes", "type": "Gene", "start": 700, "end": 720}, {"entity": "ISGs", "type": "Chemical", "start": 722, "end": 726}, {"entity": "IFN-β", "type": "Gene", "start": 766, "end": 771}, {"entity": "IFN-λ", "type": "Gene", "start": 776, "end": 781}, {"entity": "enzyme", "type": "Gene", "start": 1084, "end": 1090}, {"entity": "proteins", "type": "Gene", "start": 1010, "end": 1018}, {"entity": "proteins", "type": "Gene", "start": 1217, "end": 1225}, {"entity": "innate immune signaling", "type": "Chemical", "start": 1703, "end": 1726}]}

{"text": "JAK1 inhibition blocks lethal sterile immune responses: implications for COVID-19 therapy\tCytokine storms are drivers of pathology and mortality in myriad viral infections affecting the human population. In SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, the strength of the cytokine storm has been associated with increased risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome, myocardial damage, and death. However, the therapeutic value of attenuating the cytokine storm in COVID-19 remains to be defined. Here, we report results obtained using a novel mouse model of lethal sterile anti-viral immune responses. Using a mouse model of Down syndrome (DS) with a segmental duplication of a genomic region encoding four of the six interferon receptor genes (Ifnrs), we demonstrate that these animals overexpress Ifnrs and are hypersensitive to IFN stimulation. When challenged with viral mimetics that activate Toll-like receptor signaling and IFN anti-viral responses, these animals overproduce key cytokines, show exacerbated liver pathology, rapidly lose weight, and die. Importantly, the lethal immune hypersensitivity, accompanying cytokine storm, and liver hyperinflammation are blocked by treatment with a JAK1-specific inhibitor. Therefore, these results point to JAK1 inhibition as a potential strategy for attenuating the cytokine storm and consequent organ failure during overdrive immune responses. Additionally, these results indicate that people with DS, who carry an extra copy of the IFNR gene cluster encoded on chromosome 21, should be considered at high risk during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Many have implemented nationwide stringent control to avoid overburdening the health care system. This paralyzes economic and social activities until the availability of a vaccine, which may take years. We propose an alternative exit strategy to develop herd immunity in a predictable and controllable way: a phased lift of control. This means that successive parts of the country (e.g. provinces) stop stringent control, and Covid-19-related IC admissions are distributed over the country as the whole. Importantly, vulnerable individuals need to be shielded until herd immunity has developed in their area. We explore the characteristics and duration of this strategy using a novel individual-based model for geographically stratified transmission of Covid-19 in a country. The model predicts that individuals will have to experience stringent control for about 14 months on average, but this duration may be significantly shortened by future developments (more IC beds, better drugs).

Under our conditions, the N1 and RdRP (modified) showed the highest analytical sensitivity for their RNA targets. E assay, in its original concentration, was considered a tertiary confirmatory assay. Taken together, N1, RdRP (optimized) and E presented appropriated analytical sensibility and specificity in our automated RT-qPCR workflow for COVID-19 virus, E being at least 4-fold less sensitive than the others. This study highlights the importance of local validation of in-house assays before its availability to the population. The use of the synthetic RT-qPCR target to investigate novel assays diagnostic parameters in automated workflows is a quick, simple effective way to be prepared for upcoming threats.

The data available at the Johns Hopkins University site seem to fit well an algebraic sub-exponential growing behavior as was pointed out recently. All the provinces show a clear and consistent pattern of slowing down with growing exponent going nearly zero, so it can be said that the epidemic was contained in China. On the other side, the more recent spread in countries like, Italy, Iran, and Spain show a clear exponential growth, as well as other European countries. Even more recently, US -which was one of the first countries to have an individual infected outside China (Jan 21st, 2020)- seems to follow the same path. We calculate the exponential growth of the most affected countries, showing the evolution along time after the first local case.

{"text": "Use of a Single Ventilator to Support Multiple Patients: Modeling Tidal Volume Response to Heterogeneous Lung Mechanics\tThe COVID-19 pandemic is creating ventilator shortages in many countries that is sparking a conversation about placing multiple people on a single ventilator. However, on March 26th  the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST), along with other leading medical organizations, released a joint statement warning clinicians that attempting this technique could lead to poor outcomes and high mortality. Nevertheless, several hospitals around the United States and abroad are turning to this technique out of desperation (e.g. New York), but little data exists to guide their approach. The overall objective of this study is to utilize a computational model of mechanically ventilated lungs to assess how patient-specific lung mechanics and ventilator settings impact lung tidal volume (Vt). Methods: We developed a single compartment computational model of four patients connected to a shared ventilator and validated it against a similar experimental study. We used this model to evaluate how patient-specific lung compliance (C) and resistance (R) would impact Vt under 5 ventilator settings of pre-set PIP, PEEP, and I:E ratio (suggested by Farkas, J.D. MD as an approach by hospitals to manage multiple patients on a single ventilator). Results: Our computational model predicts Vt within 10% of experimental measurements. Using this model to perform a parametric study, we provide proof-of-concept for an algorithm to better match patients in different hypothetical scenarios of a single ventilator shared by more than one patient.  Conclusions: Assigning patients to pre-set ventilators based on their lung mechanics could be used to overcome some of the legitimate concerns of placing multiple patients on a single ventilator. We emphasize that our results are currently based on a computational model that has not been validated against any pre-clinical/clinical data.

{"text": "Full-genome evolutionary analysis of the novel corona virus (2019-nCoV) rejects the hypothesis of emergence as a result of a recent recombination event\tBackground A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) associated with human to human transmission and severe human infection has been recently reported from the city of Wuhan in China. Our objectives were to characterize the genetic relationships of the 2019-nCoV and to search for putative recombination within the subgenus of sarbecovirus. Methods Putative recombination was investigated by RDP4 and Simplot v3.5.1 and discordant phylogenetic clustering in individual genomic fragments was confirmed by phylogenetic analysis using maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods. Results Our analysis suggests that the 2019-nCoV although closely related to BatCoV RaTG13 sequence throughout the genome (sequence similarity 96.3%), shows discordant clustering with the Bat-SARS-like coronavirus sequences. Specifically, in the 5’-part spanning the first 11,498 nucleotides and the last 3’-part spanning 24,341-30,696 positions, 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 formed a single cluster with Bat-SARS-like coronavirus sequences, whereas in the middle region spanning the 3’-end of ORF1a, the ORF1b and almost half of the spike regions, 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 grouped in a separate distant lineage within the sarbecovirus branch. Conclusions The levels of genetic similarity between the 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 suggest that the latter does not provide the exact variant that caused the outbreak in humans, but the hypothesis that 2019-nCoV has originated from bats is very likely. We show evidence that the novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) is not-mosaic consisting in almost half of its genome of a distinct lineage within the betacoronavirus. These genomic features and their potential association with virus characteristics and virulence in humans need further attention.", "entities": [{"entity": "corona virus", "type": "Disease", "start": 47, "end": 59}, {"entity": "2019-nCoV", "type": "Virus", "start": 61, "end": 70}, {"entity": "2019-nCoV", "type": "Virus", "start": 184, "end": 193}, {"entity": "2019-nCoV", "type": "Virus", "start": 395, "end": 404}, {"entity": "2019-nCoV", "type": "Virus", "start": 754, "end": 763}, {"entity": "2019-nCoV", "type": "Virus", "start": 1062, "end": 1071}, {"entity": "2019-nCoV", "type": "Virus", "start": 1256, "end": 1265}, {"entity": "2019-nCoV", "type": "Virus", "start": 1404, "end": 1413}, {"entity": "2019-nCoV", "type": "Virus", "start": 1544, "end": 1553}, {"entity": "coronavirus", "type": "Virus", "start": 171, "end": 182}, {"entity": "coronavirus", "type": "Virus", "start": 917, "end": 928}, {"entity": "coronavirus", "type": "Virus", "start": 1126, "end": 1137}, {"entity": "coronavirus", "type": "Virus", "start": 1627, "end": 1638}, {"entity": "sarbecovirus", "type": "Virus", "start": 469, "end": 481}, {"entity": "sarbecovirus", "type": "Virus", "start": 1326, "end": 1338}, {"entity": "RDP4", "type": "Gene", "start": 534, "end": 538}, {"entity": "Bayesian methods", "type": "Organization", "start": 697, "end": 713}, {"entity": "nucleotides", "type": "Gene", "start": 995, "end": 1006}, {"entity": "RaTG13", "type": "Gene", "start": 799, "end": 805}, {"entity": "RaTG13", "type": "Gene", "start": 1076, "end": 1082}, {"entity": "RaTG13", "type": "Gene", "start": 1270, "end": 1276}, {"entity": "RaTG13", "type": "Gene", "start": 1418, "end": 1424}, {"entity": "2019-nCov", "type": "Virus", "start": 1640, "end": 1649}, {"entity": "betacoronavirus", "type": "Virus", "start": 1738, "end": 1753}, {"entity": "genomic features", "type": "Gene", "start": 1761, "end": 1777}]}

{"text": "The relationship of COVID-19 severity with cardiovascular disease and its traditional risk factors: A systematic review and meta-analysis\tBackground: Whether cardiovascular disease (CVD) and its traditional risk factors predict severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is uncertain, in part, because of potential confounding by age and sex.       Methods: We performed a systematic review of studies that explored pre-existing CVD and its traditional risk factors as risk factors of severe COVID-19 (defined as death, acute respiratory distress syndrome, mechanical ventilation, or intensive care unit admission). We searched PubMed and Embase for papers in English with original data (≥10 cases of severe COVID-19). Using random-effects models, we pooled relative risk (RR) estimates and conducted meta-regression analyses. Results: Of the 373 publications identified in our search, 15 papers met our inclusion criteria, with 51,845 COVID-19 patients including 9,066 severe cases. Older age was consistently associated with severe COVID-19 in all eight eligible studies, with RR >~5 in >60-65 vs. <50 years. Two studies showed no change in the RR of age after adjusting for covariate(s). In univariate analyses, factors significantly associated with severe COVID-19 were male sex (14 studies; pooled RR=1.70, [95%CI 1.52-1.89]), hypertension (10 studies; 2.74 [2.12-3.54]), diabetes (11 studies; 2.81 [2.01-3.93]), and CVD (9 studies; 3.58 [2.06-6.21]). RR for male sex was likely to be independent of age. Meta-regression analyses were suggestive of confounding by age for the other three factors. Only two studies reported multivariable analysis, with one showing non-significant association for CVD and the other demonstrating adjusted RR ~2 for hypertension and diabetes. No study explored renin-angiotensin system inhibitors as a risk factor for severe COVID-19.   Conclusions: In addition to older age and male sex, hypertension, diabetes, and CVD were associated in univariate analyses with severe COVID-19. Although there is still uncertainty regarding the magnitude of potential confounding, these risk factors can be used to inform objective decisions on COVID-19 testing, clinical management, and workforce planning.", "entities": [{"entity": "COVID-19", "type": "Disease", "start": 20, "end": 28}, {"entity": "COVID-19", "type": "Disease", "start": 261, "end": 269}, {"entity": "COVID-19", "type": "Disease", "start": 492, "end": 500}, {"entity": "COVID-19", "type": "Disease", "start": 708, "end": 716}, {"entity": "COVID-19", "type": "Disease", "start": 936, "end": 944}, {"entity": "COVID-19", "type": "Disease", "start": 1034, "end": 1042}, {"entity": "COVID-19", "type": "Disease", "start": 1260, "end": 1268}, {"entity": "COVID-19", "type": "Disease", "start": 1861, "end": 1869}, {"entity": "COVID-19", "type": "Disease", "start": 2008, "end": 2016}, {"entity": "COVID-19", "type": "Disease", "start": 2168, "end": 2176}, {"entity": "cardiovascular disease", "type": "Disease", "start": 43, "end": 65}, {"entity": "cardiovascular disease", "type": "Disease", "start": 158, "end": 180}, {"entity": "CVD", "type": "Disease", "start": 182, "end": 185}, {"entity": "CVD", "type": "Disease", "start": 429, "end": 432}, {"entity": "CVD", "type": "Disease", "start": 1422, "end": 1425}, {"entity": "CVD", "type": "Disease", "start": 1701, "end": 1704}, {"entity": "CVD", "type": "Disease", "start": 1953, "end": 1956}, {"entity": "acute respiratory distress syndrome", "type": "Phenotype", "start": 520, "end": 555}, {"entity": "hypertension", "type": "Disease", "start": 1332, "end": 1344}, {"entity": "hypertension", "type": "Disease", "start": 1752, "end": 1764}, {"entity": "hypertension", "type": "Disease", "start": 1925, "end": 1937}, {"entity": "diabetes", "type": "Disease", "start": 1377, "end": 1385}, {"entity": "diabetes", "type": "Disease", "start": 1769, "end": 1777}, {"entity": "diabetes", "type": "Disease", "start": 1939, "end": 1947}]}
